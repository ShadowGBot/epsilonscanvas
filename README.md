AI-first prototype workspace maintained by Epsilon 🦦

## Structure
- `specs/` — feature UX packets (flows, states, acceptance criteria)
- `prototypes/` — runnable prototype code
- `assets/screenshots/` — progress screenshots for sharing

## First feature flow
1. Define goal/constraints in `specs/`
2. Build prototype in `prototypes/`
3. Export screenshots to `assets/screenshots/`
4. Share links in Discord
